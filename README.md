**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This project focuses on the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to develop a model that can identify potentially fraudulent transactions, thereby helping financial institutions and cardholders to mitigate risks.

**Overview**
Dataset: The dataset used for this project contains credit card transaction data, including features such as transaction amount, location, and more.

**Tasks:**

Data preprocessing and exploration.
Encoding categorical features and scaling numeric features.
Training a RandomForestClassifier model for fraud detection.
Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC score, and a confusion matrix.
Files
Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for the entire project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Getting Started
To run this project locally or reproduce the results:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Follow the code cells step by step, executing them to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
Make sure to install the required dependencies if you haven't already.

**Results**
The project aims to provide insights into the performance of a fraud detection model on the given credit card transaction dataset. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and more will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Notes**
This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the process of credit card fraud detection using machine learning. It may not represent a production-ready system.
Feel free to explore the provided Jupyter Notebook for detailed code implementation and results. If you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out.
